This file contains a description of all parameters that may affect the 
robustness, accuracy, and speed of a simulation.  In an ideal world, there 
would be at most one such parameter, but this is not an ideal world...

Collision detection related parameters
==========================================================

XML tag: GeneralizedCCD
XML attribute: eps-tolerance
Description: Represents the  maximum amount to which a trajectory is linearized.             Values of 1e-3 are often acceptable for simulations, and this is a 
             good starting point.  If the contact points or normals seem 
             incorrect or contacts are missed, this tolerance may be lowered 
             (at the expense of greater computation time).  In general, 
             simulations seem relatively insensitive to this parameter.
Practical range: 1e-6 - 1e-3

XML tag: GeneralizedCCD
XML attribute: toi-tolerance
Description: The time-of-impact tolerance above which two points are considered 
             to be impacting at different times.  For example, if point A 
             impacts at t=0 and point B impacts at t=1e-6 and 
             toi-tolerance=1e-4, points A and B are considered to be impacting 
             simultaneously.  This parameter is necessary because points A and B
             may truly impact at the same time, though the collision detection 
             algorithm believes otherwise because of linearization errors and 
             floating point approximations.  The danger of setting this 
             parameter too small is that simultaneous contacts (e.g., a box 
             resting on the ground) will be treated sequentially, resulting in
             oscillation.  If the parameter is set too large then
             incorrect contact points may be determined (i.e., at points where 
             the bodies will not contact).  Additionally, there is no "one size 
             fits all" setting; the usable range will vary based on the size of 
             the geometries in contact.  Fortunately, there generally exists 
             both a fairly large feasible range and a method for setting this 
             parameter.  Typically, one will want to set this value
             greater than machine epsilon (~1e-20 for double precision). If 
             eps-tolerance is set low (say 1e-6), then 1e-16 may be a good 
             value; if eps-tolerance is set high (say 1e-3), then 1e-8 may be 
             more appropriate.  You will know if eps-tolerance is set too high 
             if objects that should be in resting contact do not rest; also,
             the simulation may appear to freeze.
Practical range: 0 - 1e-1

XML tag: Sphere
XML attribute: num-points
Description:  The number of points used in the discrete representation of the
              sphere.  The greater this number, the truer the approximation of
              the sphere.  If this number is too low, a sphere will not roll
              on a planar surface effectively.  If the number is too high,
              excessive collision detection computation will be required.  1000
              points generally results in a smooth discretization.
Practical range: 50 - 10000

XML tag: Cylinder
XML attribute: num-points
Description:  The number of points used in the discrete representation of the
              cylinder.  The greater this number, the truer the approximation of
              the cylinder.  If this number is too low, a cylinder will not roll
              on a planar surface effectively.  If the number is too high,
              excessive collision detection computation will be required.  1000
              points generally results in a smooth discretization.
Practical range: 50 - 10000

XML tag: Cone
XML attribute: num-points
Description:  The number of points used in the discrete representation of the
              cone.  The greater this number, the truer the approximation of
              the cone.  If this number is too high, excessive collision 
              detection computation will be required.  1000 points generally 
              results in a smooth discretization.
Practical range: 50 - 10000

XML tag: ContactData
XML attribute: max-points
Description:  The maximum number of contact points used for this pair of 
              geometries/bodies.  If the collision detection system generates
              more points than max-points, the "extra" points will be discarded
              at random.  Thus, max-points limits the work that must be done
              by the collision/contact model.  Note that- if the GeneralizedCCD
              collision detection system is in use- the discarded points
              may be re-reported (depending on how the contact model changes
              the velocities of the bodies in contact), so the simulation may
              appear to be "stuck" at time t for some number of iterations
              (any controllers that output the simulation time will report time
              t multiple times); the exact number of iterations will depend
              upon how long it takes to process all of the contact points.  To
              summarize and elaborate, it may be faster to limit the number of
              contact points than to set max-points arbitrarily high; however,
              as long as GeneralizedCCD is in use, neither the accuracy nor
              the robustness of the simulation will be affected. 
Practical range: 1 - 100

Contact model related parameters
==========================================================

XML tag: CvxOptRestitutionModel
XML attribute: tolerance
Description: The tolerance to which the convex optimization problem is solved 
             within.  The tradeoff is generally one of speed vs. accuracy, 
             though if the tolerance is too high it is possible that energy 
             gain can result.  If one wants the most accurate, robust 
             simulation possible then tolerance should be set to machine
             epsilon (~1e-20 for double precision floats) and the maximum 
             number of iterations (max-iterations) should be set to some really 
             high number (hundreds of thousands).
Practical range: machine epsilon - 1e-4

XML tag: CvxOptRestitutionModel
XML attribute: max-iterations
Description: The maximum number of iterations used by the convex optimization 
             solver.  For the most accurate simulation possible, this value 
             should be some really high number (i.e., hundreds of thousands). 
             In practice, however, convex optimization almost always requires 
             very few iterations, but setting a limit for max-iterations can be 
             used to yield better real-time performance.
Practical range: 100 - inf

XML tag: AnitescuPotraRestitutionModel
XML attribute: friction-cone-edges
Description: Half of the number of edges used in the polygonal approximation
             of the friction cone pyramid (i.e., a value of "2" yields four 
             edges [a box friction model]); the minimum value for this 
             parameter is 2.  This parameter is a strict tradeoff between 
             simulation accuracy and speed.
Practical range: 2 - 64

Articulated body related parameters
==========================================================
XML tag: MCArticulatedBody
XML attribute: baumgarte-alpha
Description: The Baumgarte stabilization method parameter alpha.  There is not
             a good prescription for picking this parameter.  Setting this
             parameter larger results in greater correction, but more "stiff"
             differential equations.
Practical range: >= 0 

XML tag: MCArticulatedBody
XML attribute: baumgarte-beta
Description:  The Baumgarte stabilization method parameter beta.  There is not
              a good prescription for picking this parameter.  Setting this
              parameter larger results in greater correction, but more "stiff"
              differential equations.
Practical range: >= 0
