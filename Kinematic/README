1.  Overview

Kinematic is a utility for loading simulation environments (via .XML files),
allowing the user to modify the environment (object transformations, joint
positions of articulated bodies, etc.), and saving the modified environments
to a new .XML file.  It is built automatically from the scons script
(the 'SConstruct') in the root Moby directory.

Loading and saving of simulation setups can be performed using the 
appropriate menu options in Kinematic.  Additionally, Kinematic takes the
following command line syntax:


Syntax: Kinematic [-x=fname] [XML file]

  -x=fname   The path to the background lights, and camera scenery filename.
             This option is identical to that used by 'driver'.

  XML file   The simulation XML file to load
