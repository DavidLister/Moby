This directory contains mobile robot examples. 

shows a mobile robot tracing the path of a figure 8 on the ground.
The robot is controlled using computed-torque control for the wheel joints and
PD-control for the base trajectory error from the desired trajectory is 
penalized, which gets translated into kinematic error for the wheels.


FILE DESCRIPTIONS

File                 Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cerror.m             Octave/Matlab code for printing out the mean error in the 
                     x,z, and theta dimensions resulting from the imperfect 
                     controller.

controller.cpp       Controller plugin for driving the robots in a 
                     figure-eight pattern.  Generates output files suitable
                     for plotting and data analysis.

ground.iv            The VRML 1.0 file for the ground visualization.

pioneer2.xml         A model of a Pioneer 2-DX mobile robot.

plot_results.m       Octave/Matlab code for plotting the true and desired joint
                     trajectories joint torques.  Requires the files 
                     "xxxx.true.out", "xxxx.out", and "xxxx.torques.out", 
                     where "xxxx" is the name of the joint in question 
                     (e.g., "left-wheel-joint"); these files will be produced
                     by the controller plugin.
