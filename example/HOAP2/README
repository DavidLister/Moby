This directory contains a the HOAP-2 humanoid robot example.  The HOAP-2 model 
is a floating-base humanoid (not constrained to the environment) with revolute, 
spherical, and universal joints.  The robot is positioned a few centimeters
above the ground, and, upon starting the simulation will drop until it
contacts the ground.  As this example does not have any controllers associated
with it, the robot will then fall to the ground.
